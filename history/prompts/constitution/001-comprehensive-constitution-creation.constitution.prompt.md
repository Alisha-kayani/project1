## Prompt

Hackathon I: Create a Textbook for Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course

The future of work will be a partnership between people, intelligent agents (AI software), and robots. This shift won't necessarily eliminate jobs but will change what humans do, leading to a massive demand for new skills. We have already written a book on AI agents. Therefore, we want you to write a textbook to teach a course in Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics (The course details are documented below). 

[User provided detailed hackathon requirements including:
- Docusaurus-based textbook
- RAG chatbot integration (Qdrant + OpenAI)
- Authentication (Better Auth)
- Content personalization
- Urdu translation
- Course content: 4 modules (ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA) + Capstone]

@project1 @memory see here i need to add consitutaion not abou the hackton this project is for hacketon i need to create a book as you read the the requirements but for now you need to create a commprehsive constition which is integral part of my project i also provide you a sample of constition so you can flow as well

[User provided example constitution from "AI Native Software Development Book" as reference]

Implement the plan as specified, it is attached for your reference. Do NOT edit the plan file itself.

To-do's from the plan have already been created. Do not create them again. Mark them as in_progress as you work, starting with the first one. Don't stop until you have completed all the to-dos.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive constitution document for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project following reasoning-based framework pattern from provided example. Constitution includes:

**Structure:**
- Section 0: Constitutional Persona (Educational Systems Architect)
- Preamble: Textbook purpose and audience
- Section I: Paradigm Shift (Digital AI → Embodied Intelligence)
- Section II: Agent Context Requirements (Intelligence Accumulation)
- Section III: 4-Module Pedagogical Framework (ROS 2, Gazebo/Unity, Isaac, VLA)
- Section IV: 8 Foundational Principles (Decision Frameworks)
- Section V: Technical Architecture Principles (Docusaurus, RAG, Auth, Personalization, Translation)
- Section VI: Agent Coordination Protocol
- Section VII: Content Creation Workflow
- Section VIII: Success Metrics
- Section IX: Governance & Amendment Process
- Section X: Supporting References

**Key Features:**
- Reasoning-based frameworks (not rigid rules)
- Decision frameworks for each principle
- Agent coordination protocols
- Technical architecture for all hackathon requirements
- Success metrics and governance structure

**File Created:**
- `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (1,325 lines, complete)

All todos completed successfully.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Comprehensive constitution document created that governs textbook creation process. Constitution follows reasoning-based framework pattern, provides decision frameworks for all aspects of content creation, technical integration, and agent coordination. Ready for use in textbook development.
- 🧪 Tests: Constitution structure validated, all sections present, no linting errors
- 📁 Files: `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (complete, 1,325 lines)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Module planning, lesson writing, technical implementation following constitutional principles
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution successfully adapts reasoning-based framework from example to Physical AI domain. Includes all hackathon requirements (RAG, auth, personalization, translation) as first-class principles. Structure supports both content creation and technical integration workflows.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - constitution created successfully following plan
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Structure validation PASS, Linting PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin module planning using constitutional principles
