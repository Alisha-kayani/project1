## Course Information

**Course Title**: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Bridging the Gap Between Digital Brain and Physical Body

**Version**: 1.0.0

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-29

**Course Type**: Self-paced online textbook

**Estimated Duration**: 16-20 weeks (4 modules × 2 weeks each + capstone project)

**Format**: Interactive textbook with hands-on exercises and projects

## Course Description

This course teaches Physical AI—AI systems that function in physical reality and comprehend physical laws. Students learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action models.

**Core Philosophy**: Physical AI represents a fundamental transformation from AI models confined to digital environments to embodied intelligence operating in physical space. Mastery requires understanding both the digital brain (AI/ML) and the physical body (robotics hardware, simulation, control systems).

## Target Audience

This course is designed for multiple audiences:

- **Complete Beginners**: Those entering robotics and AI for the first time—we start from fundamentals
- **Traditional Developers**: Experienced software developers transitioning to physical AI
- **Robotics Enthusiasts**: Those with hardware experience seeking AI integration
- **AI Practitioners**: ML/AI engineers exploring embodied intelligence

**No Prior Experience Required**: The course assumes no prior knowledge of ROS, robotics, or AI. Basic command-line familiarity and comfort with reading code (Python examples provided) are helpful but not required.

## Course Structure

The course is organized into 4 progressive modules plus a capstone project:

1. **Module 1: ROS 2 (Robotic Nervous System)** - Foundational middleware and distributed systems
2. **Module 2: Gazebo & Unity (Digital Twin)** - Physics simulation and validation
3. **Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac (AI-Robot Brain)** - AI-powered perception and manipulation
4. **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Natural language control and integration
5. **Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid** - Complete system integration project

Each module builds on previous ones, creating a progressive learning path from fundamentals to advanced integration.
